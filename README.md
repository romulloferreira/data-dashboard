## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

For this project we will use Plotly JavaScript Open Source Graphing Library, and to generate the visualizations we will use static data inserted into the files plot1.js, plot2.js, plot3.js, plot4.js, plot5.js and/or plot6.js. the data is real and was collected from the OpenDatSUS website.

Plotly's open-source graphing libraries are free to use, work offline and don't require any account registration.
